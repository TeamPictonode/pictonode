# Pictonode

Pictonode is an image editor using a revolutionary node-based system that allows for greater flexibility and reproducibility. The end goal is to make image processing a parallelized process that anyone can take part in, regardless of their technical background. In addition, we also aim to allow those already familiar with contemporary image editing software to easily transition to Pictonode. 

The web backend for Pictonode is currently live at http://pictonode.com.
