## Depends On

GIMP 2.99+

## Install

With GIMP 2.99+, plugins must exist inside of their own subdirectory within any folder listed as a plugin folder under Edit>Preferences>Folders>Plugins. To install, just copy the Pictonode folder into any one of these folders. On Windows, there are two default plugin folders:

```
C:\Program Files\GIMP 2.99\lib\gimp\2.99\plug-ins
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.99\plug-ins
```
